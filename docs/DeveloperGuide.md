## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `SingleDeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1500" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Symptom` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Symptom` object per unique symptom, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Symptom` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1500" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Automatic Triage Sorting

The Automatic Triage Sorting mechanism ensures that the patient list is always ordered by medical severity, allowing triage coordinators to identify critical cases immediately.

This feature is facilitated by the `Urgency` and `Ic` classes, and is integrated directly into the `Person` model. The sorting logic relies on Java's `Comparable<T>` interface to enforce a strict, deterministic order every time the list of patients is modified (e.g., during an `add` or `update` command).

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The sorting logic comparison can be conceptually represented by the following mathematical formula:
`Triage Priority = (Urgency Weight * 10) + IC Lexicographical Value`
</box>

#### Sorting Logic Flow
1. **Primary Sort (Urgency):** The `Urgency` class implements `Comparable<Urgency>`. It assigns internal weightages to its valid states (`EXTREME` = 4, `HIGH` = 3, `MODERATE` = 2, `LOW` = 1). When two patients are compared, the one with the higher urgency weight is placed higher in the list.
2. **Secondary Sort (Tie-Breaker):** If two patients have the exact same `Urgency`, the `Person#compareTo()` method falls back to comparing their `Ic` objects. The `Ic` class implements `Comparable<Ic>` and uses standard lexicographical string comparison to ensure a consistent, deterministic order.

#### Class Diagram
The following class diagram shows how the `Comparable` interface is implemented across the domain models:

<puml src="diagrams/TriageSortingClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

#### Sequence of Events
When a user executes a command that alters the patient list (like `add` or `update`), the internal list must re-sort itself.
1. The `LogicManager` executes the command, which calls `Model#addPerson(Person)`.
2. The `ModelManager` adds the patient to the `UniquePersonList`.
3. The `UniquePersonList` internal list (or a wrapping `SortedList` in the UI) triggers the `Person#compareTo(Person)` method.
4. The list is re-ordered and the UI updates automatically to reflect the new triage hierarchy.

#### Design Considerations: Triage Sorting

**Aspect: How to maintain the sorted order of the patient list.**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation):** Implement `Comparable` in `Model` and enforce sorting at the `UniquePersonList` level or UI `SortedList` level automatically upon any modification.
    * *Pros:* The UI and internal data are always inherently synchronized. No explicit `sort` command needs to be called by the user, fitting the fast-paced triage environment.
    * *Cons:* Slight performance overhead since sorting occurs on every single addition or update (O(n log n) time complexity per modification).
* **Alternative 2:** Do not sort automatically. Create a separate `sort` command that the user must type manually.
    * *Pros:* Better performance during rapid, sequential `add` operations.
    * *Cons:* Highly dangerous in a medical triage context. If a user forgets to type `sort`, an `EXTREME` urgency patient might be left at the bottom of the list, leading to critical delays in care.

**Reason for choosing Alternative 1:** In a clinical setting, data accuracy and immediate visibility of critical patients strictly outweigh the minor performance cost of automatic sorting. "Security by Design" principles dictate that the system should fail-safe; automatically sorting ensures no critical patient is ever accidentally hidden.

### List feature

#### Implementation

The list mechanism lets users view either **all** patients or a **filtered** subset by **urgency level** (`u/`) and/or **symptoms** (`s/`). It is facilitated by **`ListCommand`** and **`ListCommandParser`**, which implement the following behaviour:

* **`ListCommandParser#parse(String)`** — Tokenizes `u/` and `s/` prefixes via `ArgumentTokenizer`, validates urgency values with `ParserUtil#parseUrgencyLevel` and symptom names with `ParserUtil#parseSymptom`, and builds a **`Predicate<Person>`**. If the user leaves arguments empty, it returns a `ListCommand` that uses `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`, mimicking the behaviour of the original List feature.
* **`ListCommand#execute(Model)`** — Calls **`Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`**, then formats feedback from the size of **`Model#getFilteredPersonList()`** (success with count, empty book message, or **`CommandException`** when a filter matches no one).

Unprefixed text after `list` (e.g. `list fever`) is **rejected** so that filtering stays explicit and consistent with the rest of the CLI.

**Combining filters:** When both urgency and symptom criteria are present, a person must match **both** dimensions (logical **AND**). Multiple `u/` or `s/` repetitions are normalized to sets; within each set, a match on **any** listed urgency (respectively symptom) is enough.

**Data and undo:** Listing does **not** change stored patient data; it only updates the **filtered view** in the model. `ListCommand` does not override `Command#isUndoable()`, so it remains **non-undoable**, like `find`.

Given below is a example usage scenario.

**Step 1.** The user previously ran a command that narrowed the UI (for example `find`), and wants to see every patient again. They execute `list` with no parameters. `ListCommandParser` returns a `ListCommand` with `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`; after execution, the UI shows the full list.

**Step 2.** The user executes `list u/high` to focus on high-urgency patients. The parser builds a predicate that keeps only persons whose urgency string matches `high`; `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` updates the `FilteredList`.

**Step 3.** The user executes `list u/high s/fever`. The parser combines predicates so that only persons who are **both** high urgency **and** have a fever symptom (case-insensitive) remain visible.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the address book is empty, `list` with no filter returns an empty-list message. If filters are provided but **no** person matches, `ListCommand` throws a **`CommandException`** so the user knows the criteria returned no matches rather than the database is empty.

</box>

The class diagram below summarizes the main types involved in the list feature:

<puml src="diagrams/ListFeatureClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />

The following sequence diagram shows how a filtered `list` command flows through the **Logic** component (example: `list u/high`):

<puml src="diagrams/ListSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="ListSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

How **`Model#updateFilteredPersonList`** updates the view is shown below (concrete class **`ModelManager`** delegates to JavaFX **`FilteredList`**):

<puml src="diagrams/ListSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="ListSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The activity diagram below summarizes parsing and execution outcomes:

<puml src="diagrams/ListActivityDiagram.puml" width="550" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Strict prefixes vs free-text filtering**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Require `u/` and `s/`; reject unprefixed arguments.
    * *Pros:* Unambiguous parsing; aligns with `add` / `update` style; fewer accidental partial matches.
    * *Cons:* Slightly more typing than a single free-text query.

* **Alternative 2:** Accept raw keywords (e.g. `list fever`) and guess intent.
    * *Pros:* Faster for casual typing.
    * *Cons:* Ambiguity between urgency labels, symptom names, and future fields; worse error messages.

### Command History Navigation

#### Implementation

The command history navigation feature allows users to cycle through previously successfully executed commands using the up/down arrow keys. The command history is kept so that no duplicated commands. This is implemented in the `CommandHistory` class, which maintains a list of previously executed commands strings that are trimmed to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, a pointer to the current position in that history, and the current user input being typed. The command history is session-based, meaning that the command history is cleared when the app is closed and does not persist across sessions.

The `CommandHistory` class provides the following methods:
* `CommandHistory#add(String command)` — Adds a new command to the history and resets the pointer to the end of the list.
* `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand(String currentInput)` — Moves the pointer up to the previous command and returns it. If the pointer is already at the top of the history, it remains there and returns the same command.
* `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()` — Moves the pointer down to the next command and returns it. If the pointer is already at the end of the history, it remains there and returns an empty string (indicating no command).
* `CommandHistory#removeAnyDuplicateCommands(String command)` — Removes any existing occurrence of the given command from the history to prevent duplicates.

<box type="info" seamless>

* If there is a duplicate command in the history, it is removed before adding the new command. This ensures that the history contains only unique commands, and the most recent occurrence of a command is what gets stored.

* Duplicate commands are identified using case-insensitive comparison after trimming leading and trailing whitespace. A command is considered a duplicate only if it **exactly** matches an existing command in the history list.

</box>

The `CommandBox` class listens for key presses and interacts with the `CommandHistory` to update the command input field accordingly when the user presses the up/down arrow keys.

Here is a class diagram summarizing the main types involved in the command history feature:

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryClassDiagram.puml" width="300" />

Given below is an example usage scenario. Assume there are already some patient records in the address book before the user executes any command.

**Step 1.** The user executes the command `add pn/Alice …​`. The `CommandHistory` adds this command to its history list and resets the pointer to the end.

**Step 2.** The user executes the command `delete 1`. The `CommandHistory` adds this command to its history list and resets the pointer to the end. 

**Step 3.** The user enters a partial command `add pn/Bob` but has not executed it yet. This partial input is stored in the `CommandHistory` as the current user input, but it is not added to the history list until it is executed.

**Step 4.** The user now presses the up arrow key. The `CommandHistory` moves the pointer up to the previous command (`delete 1`) and returns it, which is then displayed in the command input field.

**Step 5.** The user presses the up arrow key again. The `CommandHistory` moves the pointer up to the previous command (`add pn/Alice …​`) and returns it, which is then displayed in the command input field.

**Step 6.** The user presses the up arrow key again. Since the pointer is already at the top of the history, it remains there and returns the same command (`add pn/Alice …​`), which is displayed in the command input field.

**Step 7.** The user now presses the down arrow key. The `CommandHistory` moves the pointer down to the next command (`delete 1`) and returns it, which is displayed in the command input field.

**Step 8.** The user presses the down arrow key again. The `CommandHistory` moves the pointer down to the end of the history (since there are no more commands), and returns the initial partial command input (`add pn/Bob`), which is displayed in the command input field.

Here is a sequence diagram showing how the command history navigation works when the user presses the up arrow key (Assuming there are already some commands in the history and that the previous command in the history is `delete 1`):

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CommandHistorySequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

Note that `getPreviousCommand("")` method is taking in an empty string, that means that the user has not typed anything in the command box before pressing the up arrow key.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes the behavior of the command history navigation when the user presses the up/down arrow keys:

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryActivityDiagram-Up-Down.puml" width="400" />

The following activity diagram summarizes the behavior of the command history navigation when the user enters a new command (e.g., `add pn/Charlie …​`) and executes it:

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistoryActivityDiagram-Enter.puml" width="600" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add pn/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add pn/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should be fully operable using only the keyboard, with no mouse interaction required.
5.  Should gracefully handle a corrupted or missing data file by starting with an empty address book, without crashing. 
6.  Should not lose any patient data if the application is closed unexpectedly (e.g. power failure), as data is saved after every command.

*{More to be added}*

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, MacOS
* **Above average typing speed**: 40 words per minute (wpm) or more, which is the average typing speed for regular English text.
* **Patient record**: A record containing the details of a patient.
* **Patient details**: The details of a patient, which include their name, phone number, address, email, IC number, attending doctor, urgency level, symptoms and notes.
* **Triage coordinator**: A user who is responsible for managing the patient records and ensuring that patients are prioritized based on their urgency level.
* **Expert user**: A user who is familiar with the app and its features, and can use it efficiently to manage patient records.
* **Beginner user**: A user who is new to the app and may not be familiar with all its features, but can still use it to manage patient records with some guidance.
* **User**: A user, which can be either a triage coordinator, an expert user or a beginner user.
* **Address book**: The collection of patient records stored in the app, represented as an `AddressBook` object.
* **Person/Patient**: A patient record in the address book, represented as a `Person` object. They are used interchangeably, but they refer to the same thing in the context of this app.
* **Urgency**: A classification of a patient's medical severity. Valid levels are `EXTREME`, `HIGH`, `MODERATE`, and `LOW`, listed from highest to lowest priority.
* **IC number**: A unique national identification number used to identify a patient (e.g. `T0123456B`). Used as the primary key to prevent duplicate patient records.
* **Triage priority**: The computed order in which patients are ranked in the list, determined first by urgency level and then by IC number lexicographically as a tie-breaker.
* **Filtered list**: The subset of patient records currently displayed in the UI after applying search or filter criteria. Does not affect the underlying stored data.
* **Session**: A single run of the application from launch to close. Command history is session-based and does not persist across sessions.
* **Next-of-kin**: An emergency contact associated with a patient record, including their name, phone number, and relationship to the patient.
